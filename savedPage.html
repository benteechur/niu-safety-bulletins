<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

The extended duration of heat, combined with nearly full sunshine, and oppressive warmth even at night will lead to potentially hazardous conditions, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.  NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs.  You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert, and trust your instincts</strong>. Be aware of your surroundings.  If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn't.  Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><strong>Watch out for each other</strong>. Don’t be a bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><strong>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.</strong> Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe – a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free. NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs. You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Be&#160;alert, and trust your instincts.</span>&#160;Be aware of your surroundings.&#160; If a situation doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. &#160;Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><span>Watch out for each other.</span>&#160;Be an active bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><span>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.&#160;</span>Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe &#8211; a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free. NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs. You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Be&#160;alert, and trust your instincts.</span>&#160;Be aware of your surroundings.&#160; If a situation doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. &#160;Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><span>Watch out for each other.</span>&#160;Be an active bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><span>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.&#160;</span>Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe &#8211; a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free.

<li><span>Be&#160;alert, and trust your instincts.</span>&#160;Be aware of your surroundings.&#160; If a situation doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. &#160;Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place.

<li><span>Watch out for each other.</span>&#160;Be an active bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><span>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.&#160;</span>Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe &#8211; a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>

<p>The Northern Illinois University campus is a safe one, but a large university campus and its surrounding community will not be crime free. NIU and DeKalb Police and other partner law enforcement agencies work together to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs. You, too, play a very important role in keeping our campus and community safe.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Be&#160;alert, and trust your instincts.</span>&#160;Be aware of your surroundings.&#160; If a situation doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. &#160;Contact police if something looks suspicious or out of place. Any information, no matter how small, can contribute to preventing a crime.</li>
<li><span>Watch out for each other.</span>&#160;Be an active bystander. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger.</li>
<li><span>If you hear or see a fire alarm, leave the building immediately.&#160;</span>Just because you cannot see flames or smoke does not mean you are safe &#8211; a fire or other hazard could be in another part of the building and rapidly spread to where you are.</li>
